# Zen Cart English Strings for Translation
Zen Cart 2.1.0 English strings extracted and converted from database or database install files to make admin menus translation easier.

To use:
- Rename all `english` folders to your new language.
- Translate all files content.
- Rename `admin` folders to your actual admin folder name, except for encapsulated plugins where you should let it as is.
- Copy `ZenCart_folder` content to your Zen Cart folder keeping folder structure.
- Eventually copy plugins files you need from `Plugins` folder. For encapsulated plugins, just copy plugin's folder to Zen Cart's `zc_plugins` folder. For non-encapsulated plugins, copy each plugin's folder **content** to Zen cart root.

Now, all menus and submenus in Zen Cart admin should display in your new language when you switch it on.
